## Graph Neural Networks for Stock Portfolio Optimization

This project focuses on the utilization of Relational Graph Attention Networks (R-GATs) in the context of Asset Portfolio Allocation. By adopting an end-to-end optimization approach, the study aims to enhance the effectiveness of portfolio allocation strategies. The dataset employed in this research comprises data on the largest US Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), offering a comprehensive representation of the market.

To capture relevant information for the graph-based modeling, a set of features is derived from popular technical indicators. To ensure the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, the study incorporates Prioritized Experience Replay (PER).
