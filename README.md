## Graph Neural Networks for Stock Portfolio Optimization

This project focuses on the utilization of Relational Graph Attention Networks (R-GATs) in the context of Asset Portfolio Allocation. By adopting an end-to-end optimization approach, the study aims to enhance the effectiveness of portfolio allocation strategies. The dataset employed in this research comprises data on the largest US Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), offering a comprehensive representation of the market.

To capture relevant information for the graph-based modeling, a set of features is derived from popular technical indicators. Additionally, the adjacency matrices that define the relationships between the vertices are constructed based on covariance matrices, encompassing the interdependencies among the ETFs. 

To ensure the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm, the study incorporates Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). This technique enables the network to focus on important and informative experiences, facilitating more effective learning and optimization processes.
